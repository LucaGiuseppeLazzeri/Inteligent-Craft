Project Description

Intelligent craft is a Java written text based adventure game that has been developed as part of a group project with students 2129374 and 2110825. The game is set on a desolate planet where the player must build a rocket ship to escape. The game contains a combat mechanism where the user can attack heal or run. As the player progresses through they face enemies of an increasing difficulty to gain gold and XP to build parts for the rockets.

Welcome to my game, this is a text based adventure game based on the group project I have worked on with students 2129374 and 2110825.

This program is written in java using Java19.

You will notice in our diagrams it was a heavily GUI based game with combat mechanisms I had tried to recreate using the text based interface of the command line interface.

I have also expanded upon other elements to make the game play experience of the CLI to be more enjoyable. An example of this is the ability to use potions which loosely ties into our a Mana Point system where the player could build up mana over time.

During the game you will face up against numerous enemies who when killed will drop gold and XP for the user to collect. 

This gold can be used to buy parts to build the Rocket ship to escape the desolate planet. 

The XP system is used to determine at what act you are at in the game which will increase the difficulty of the enemy you face and in turn with the harder enemies comes more XP and gold for your character.

When looking through the code there is heavy ammount of code no longer in use and has been commented out. This code has been left here so you can see the progression of how my code has came and also for my own reference so if there is any ideas or other ways to solve issues come up I can use it to improve my working code
